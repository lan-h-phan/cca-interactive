Nicky Case’s advice: 
1. Show what made you care, not why you care
2. Show then tell
3. Therefore & But, not And then
4. Write a draft, then cut it 10%
5. Do real tests, early & often
    Prioritize actual learning over the feeling of learning

#### Chapter 1: Introduction ####

Scene 1: 
    A field with the Alpaca

    (N)arrator: In a faraway land reside many animal groups with their own distinctive cultures. 
            They all find ways to share the resources available to them. 
            However, conflict arises from time to time, threating the harmonious existence of the species. 

        Welcome to the cross-cultural adaptivity interactive game, where you are Alpaca - our conflict resolution expert.

        Your main goal is to work with other animals on how to resolve their conflicts. 

        Throughout the game, you will be able to choose to use your expertise or to learn from the animals directly involved. 

        Your choices will directly affect the outcomes of the game. 

        Disclaimer: this is a work of fiction, so any actions from this game is not a reflection of how animals might react in the real world.
