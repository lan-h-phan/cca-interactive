Maybe based on Nicky Case’s Wisdom/ Madness of Crowds
Nicky Case’s advice: 
1. Show what made you care, not why you care
2. Show then tell
3. Therefore & But, not And then
4. Write a draft, then cut it 10%
5. Do real tests, early & often
    Prioritize actual learning over the feeling of learning

Overall Notes

1. What is my cause and effect?
    cross-cultural challenges -> wrong training styles -> failure
    cross-cultural challenges -> right training styles -> success
    prescriptive -> boringggg -> people reject/ no sustainability
    elicitive -> too much resources -> failure

2. What is my core set of rules?
    there are multiple parties (Eastern/ Western, mono-cultural/multi-cultural)
    they are connected/ disconnected from each other (tight/loose and trusted processes)
    a person is an outsider/ instructor; goal is to reach to most folks; 


What factors do I want to include:
- Instructor/ participant cultural orientation? When there is a fit, 
    the person is same color, no resources drained
- Tight-loose cultural norms
- Local capacity for bridge building (fair & just)
- Idk how to include instructor tolerance for ambiguity though??

Number of connections drawn = resources?
Or can the % be the resources or knowledge

Learning bottom-up and top-down: arrow directions might influence source of knowledge?
instructor is orange, local is green, when mixed is yellow; default is grey
Instead of pencil, maybe lightbulb?

*** Chapter 0. Introduction ***

International peacebuilding has been trying to pivot to local expertise, 
but has been unsuccessful

You are an instructor (arrow to orange circle with hat), invited to conduct conflict resolution training.

(interactive + character introduction)
Orange instructor on the left (100%), a few orange on the right. 
Draw a line from you to your participants.
(both smile). 
Congrats, you have successfully share your ideas!

(interactive + character introduction)
Orange instructor on the left, a few grey on the right. 
Unlike the prior participant, you are of different colors! 
What happens when you draw a line from you to your participant?
(change their minds but the level goes to 50%)
You have successfully learn from your participant and co-create knowledge.
Do you notice any difference?
<next> Why? 

What you just did represent the two camps of conflict resolution education. 
Noticing the tension between the outsider and local knowledge, 
John Paul Lederach introduced the prescriptive-elicitive framework in Preparing for Peace. 
One is prescriptive/ top-down knowledge, the other is elicitive/ bottom-up.

In the first instance, you and your participant were both orange, so you had mutual understanding of the orange group norms. 
In this case, you could share your expertise.

On the other hand, when you and your participant were from different groups, you need to work elicitively to apply to their cultural context. 

But reality is a bit more complicated: not everyone will be 100% similar to you or completely different in culture. 
And in conflict situations, you tend to work with more than one participant.

That leads to our next part: Training in Groups.


*** Chapter 1. Groups ***
Here is a group with different folks. You have people who are 100% similar to you culturally, 
you have people who are somewhat alike, and you have people who are
